aa-kernel is an embedded multi-tasking operating system for

useful as the software component in FPGA/SoC design projects.
See aa-hardware, also on my Github, for examples of these.
Documentation, including the (overview)[https://github.com/pfnsec/aa-kernel/blob/master/doc/abstract.pdf], can be found in /doc.
